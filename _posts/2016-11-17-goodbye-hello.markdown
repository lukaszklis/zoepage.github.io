The decision was not easy. I do believe that the combination of design and artificial intelligence is the future. Where content should drive design decisions and support writers to create a better experience while focusing on what they do best. I  will miss my team of open-minded, creative and passionate people, who care about their code.


I truly believe in the Open Web, which should be accessible for everyone. But we all know, we can get very different experiences depending on our device or user agent. This is why we need the web compatibility project and I'm stoked to be a part of this soon.

#### What is Web Compatibility?

Web compatibility is about making sure web sites work consistently across all browsers and devices. Sometimes, sites have bugs or policies that prevent them from working well in every browser. We work to help web developers and site owners identify and fix such issues.

This project is an open invitation for all web users, developers and browser vendors to get involved in the web compatibility effort. Our goal is to make it easy to report and solve problems for any part of the web.

#### Want to learn more?
Mike Taylor gave a [brilliant introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2kK_wd1xzY) at ViewSource Berlin this year. 

You can also head over to [the Web Compat Project](https://webcompat.com/) and check it out!



The web is big and keeps getting bigger. And we need to make sure it’s all a solid base, we can build our future on. I’m very excited about making an impact on the open web again!
