I’m proud to announce that I’ll be joining the Web Compatibility Project at Mozilla as a platform engineer.

The decision was not easy. I truly believe that the combination of design and artificial intelligence is the future. Especially for e-commerce. Where content should drive design decisions and support writers to create a better experience while focusing on what they can do best. I also will miss my team a lot. A team of open-minded, creative and passionate people, who care about their code.

But I also truly believe in the Open Web, which should be accessible for everyone. But we all know, we can get very different experiences depending on our device or user agent. This is why we need the web compatibility project.

##### What is Web Compatibility?

Web compatibility is about making sure web sites work consistently across all browsers and devices. Sometimes, sites have bugs or policies that prevent them from working well in every browser. We work to help web developers and site owners identify and fix such issues.

This project is an open invitation for all web users, developers and browser vendors to get involved in the web compatibility effort. Our goal is to make it easy to report and viel problems for any part of the web.

##### How can I support the project?

Very first step (and also the most important one) is, go to https://webcompat.com/ and report bugs. There are even extensions / add-ons for Safari, Chrome and Firefox to make it easier for you! Add the description of the bug and the URL. Done!

If this is not enough and you feel, you should do more to help the web? The web combat project is developed by volunteers. 
Grab one of the bugs already reported and help us find out why this happens! The more people, the more knowledge. Also? 
You’ll finally have the voice to help change the web.

Mike Taylor gave a brilliant introduction at ViewSource Berlin this year. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2kK_wd1xzY


The web is big and keeps getting bigger. To make sure it’s all compatible we need help from people in all regions of the world. The great thing is anyone can help. You don’t need to be a developer and as little as 5 minutes can make a huge difference!


###### I’m very excited about the future and about making an impact on the web again!
